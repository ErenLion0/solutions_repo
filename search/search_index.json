Theoretical Background When a projectile is launched with an initial velocity \\( v_0 \\) at an angle \\( \\theta \\), its motion can be broken down into: Horizontal motion (constant velocity) Vertical motion (accelerated motion due to gravity) The total horizontal range (\\( R \\)) of the projectile can be derived using the following formula: \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin 2\\theta}{g} \\] where: \\( v_0 \\) = initial velocity (m/s) \\( \\theta \\) = launch angle (\u00b0) \\( g \\) = acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s\u00b2) From this equation, the maximum range occurs at \\( \\theta = 45^\\circ \\) because \\( \\sin 90^\\circ = 1 \\), which is its highest possible value. Experiment Setup To simulate the projectile motion experiment, we assumed: Fixed initial velocity : \\( v_0 = 10 \\) m/s Measured angles : 15\u00b0, 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 75\u00b0 Gravity value : \\( g = 9.81 \\) m/s\u00b2 Air resistance ignored The range was calculated using the formula and compared with the theoretical prediction. Experimental Data & Results The following table shows the measured ranges for different launch angles: Launch Angle (\u00b0) Calculated Range (m) 15\u00b0 5.02 30\u00b0 8.84 45\u00b0 10.19 60\u00b0 8.84 75\u00b0 5.02 \ud83d\udd0d Observation: The range is maximum at 45\u00b0 , confirming our theoretical expectation. Graph: The plot below shows the variation of range with launch angle: Colab Link Discussion Maximum Range: The longest distance was recorded at 45\u00b0 , aligning with theoretical predictions. Symmetry in Data: Angles 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 yielded the same range. Similarly, 15\u00b0 and 75\u00b0 had equal ranges. Conclusion The experiment successfully confirmed that the optimal launch angle for maximum range is 45\u00b0 . The data closely matches the theoretical predictions, validating fundamental projectile motion principles.","title":"\ud83d\udccc Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem%201/#investigating-the-range-as-a-function-of-the-angle-of-projection","text":"","title":"\ud83d\udccc Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem%201/#problem-statement","text":"The goal of this experiment is to analyze the relationship between the launch angle (\\( \\theta \\)) and the horizontal range (\\( R \\)) of a projectile.","title":"Problem Statement"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem%201/#theoretical-background","text":"When a projectile is launched with an initial velocity \\( v_0 \\) at an angle \\( \\theta \\), its motion can be broken down into: Horizontal motion (constant velocity) Vertical motion (accelerated motion due to gravity) The total horizontal range (\\( R \\)) of the projectile can be derived using the following formula: \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin 2\\theta}{g} \\] where: \\( v_0 \\) = initial velocity (m/s) \\( \\theta \\) = launch angle (\u00b0) \\( g \\) = acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s\u00b2) From this equation, the maximum range occurs at \\( \\theta = 45^\\circ \\) because \\( \\sin 90^\\circ = 1 \\), which is its highest possible value.","title":"Theoretical Background"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem%201/#experiment-setup","text":"To simulate the projectile motion experiment, we assumed: Fixed initial velocity : \\( v_0 = 10 \\) m/s Measured angles : 15\u00b0, 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 75\u00b0 Gravity value : \\( g = 9.81 \\) m/s\u00b2 Air resistance ignored The range was calculated using the formula and compared with the theoretical prediction.","title":"Experiment Setup"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem%201/#experimental-data-results","text":"The following table shows the measured ranges for different launch angles: Launch Angle (\u00b0) Calculated Range (m) 15\u00b0 5.02 30\u00b0 8.84 45\u00b0 10.19 60\u00b0 8.84 75\u00b0 5.02 \ud83d\udd0d Observation: The range is maximum at 45\u00b0 , confirming our theoretical expectation.","title":"Experimental Data &amp; Results"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem%201/#graph","text":"The plot below shows the variation of range with launch angle: Colab Link","title":"Graph:"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem%201/#discussion","text":"Maximum Range: The longest distance was recorded at 45\u00b0 , aligning with theoretical predictions.

This type of pendulum is called a forced damped pendulum . You will learn: What the motion looks like, How to describe it with a mathematical equation, What happens when we change different parameters (like friction or the push), And how to simulate it using Python. \ud83d\udcda What Is a Forced Damped Pendulum? A normal pendulum swings back and forth because of gravity. But if you: Add friction (like air resistance), And push it periodically (like tapping it every second), ...then its motion becomes more interesting \u2014 and sometimes unpredictable. This system is called a forced damped pendulum . To study it, we use a mathematical equation. The equation describes how the pendulum moves over time. \ud83e\uddee The Equation of Motion The movement of the pendulum is described using this differential equation: \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + b\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\frac{g}{L}\\sin(\\theta) = A\\cos(\\omega t \\] Let\u2019s break it down: \\( \\theta \\) (theta) is the angle of the pendulum from the vertical (in radians). \\( \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} \\) is the acceleration (how fast the angle changes). \\( \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} \\) is the angular velocity (how fast it\u2019s swinging). \\( b \\) is the damping coefficient \u2013 it controls how strong the friction is. \\( g \\) is the gravitational acceleration (about 9.81 m/s\u00b2 on Earth). \\( L \\) is the length of the pendulum . \\( A \\) is the amplitude of the external force \u2013 how hard we are pushing it. \\( \\omega \\) (omega) is the frequency of the force \u2013 how often we push it. \\( \\cos(\\omega t) \\) is the periodic push (a cosine wave). \ud83e\udde0 Why Is This System Interesting? This system behaves in many different ways , depending on the values of the parameters. Some key behaviors: If friction is strong, the pendulum slows down and stops. If you push it at the right frequency, it can swing higher and higher \u2014 this is called resonance . If the force is strong and damping is low, the motion can become chaotic \u2014 completely unpredictable and never repeating. This is why scientists love this system: it\u2019s simple to define, but the motion can become incredibly complex. \ud83e\uddea Simplifying the Equation When the angle is very small , we can use this approximation: \\[ \\sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta \\] This turns the equation into a simpler, linear one: \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + b\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\frac{g}{L}\\theta = A\\cos(\\omega t) \\] This version is easier to solve and helps us understand basic behaviors like resonance and damping. \ud83d\udcbb Simulating the Pendulum with Python We can use a simple Python script to simulate how the pendulum moves. The code uses Euler\u2019s method , a numerical technique to approximate the motion. Below is the full code.
