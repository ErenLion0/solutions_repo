By combining theoretical derivation with simulated data, we aim to verify the mathematical model and understand its implications in real-world contexts. Theoretical Background Newton's Second Law To analyze projectile motion, we begin with Newton\u2019s Second Law of Motion: \\[ F = m \\cdot a \\] This law states that the net force acting on an object is equal to its mass multiplied by its acceleration. In projectile motion (without air resistance), gravity is the only force acting on the vertical direction. 1. Vertical Motion The vertical force due to gravity: \\[ F_y = -mg \\] From Newton's Second Law: \\[ ma_y = -mg \\Rightarrow a_y = -g \\] This gives: \\[ \\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} = -g \\] Integrating: \\[ \\frac{dy}{dt} = v_y(t) = v_0 \\sin \\theta - g t \\] And again: \\[ y(t) = v_0 \\sin \\theta \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\] 2. Horizontal Motion No horizontal force implies constant velocity: \\[ F_x = 0 \\Rightarrow a_x = 0 \\] So: \\[ \\frac{dx}{dt} = v_0 \\cos \\theta \\Rightarrow x(t) = v_0 \\cos \\theta \\cdot t \\] 3. Time of Flight Setting vertical displacement to zero at landing: \\[ 0 = v_0 \\sin \\theta \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\] Solving: \\[ t = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad t = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin \\theta}{g} \\] 4. Range Derivation Using total flight time in horizontal equation: \\[ R = v_0 \\cos \\theta \\cdot \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin \\theta}{g} \\] Apply identity: \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin 2\\theta}{g} \\] This formula predicts how the angle of projection influences the range. Experiment Setup To simulate the projectile motion experiment, we assumed: Fixed initial velocity : ($ v_0 = 10 $) m/s Measured angles : 15\u00b0, 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 75\u00b0 Gravity : \\( g = 9.81 \\) m/s\u00b2 Air resistance ignored Range values were calculated using the derived formula and compared across angles. Experimental Data & Results Launch Angle (\u00b0) Calculated Range (m) 15\u00b0 5.02 30\u00b0 8.84 45\u00b0 10.19 60\u00b0 8.84 75\u00b0 5.02 Analysis of the Range The graph plotting horizontal range against launch angle forms a symmetrical curve , peaking at 45\u00b0 , which matches the theoretical prediction: \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin 2\\theta}{g} \\] Key Observations: Maximum range at 45\u00b0, where ( \\(\\sin 2\\theta = 1\\) ) Symmetrical behavior : 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0, as well as 15\u00b0 and 75\u00b0, yield equal ranges The symmetry comes from the identity: ( \\(\\sin 2\\theta = \\sin(180^\\circ - 2\\theta\\) ) The graph has a parabolic shape , clearly demonstrating that the range does not increase linearly with angle. These results confirm that our theoretical derivation holds true in practice. Practical Applications Understanding how range depends on launch angle has numerous real-world applications: Sports: Enhancing performance in basketball, golf, soccer, and other projectile-based sports. Military: Calculating precise trajectories for artillery and missile systems. Engineering: Designing equipment or machines that follow parabolic paths (e.g., robotic arms, excavators). Aerospace: Launching and landing spacecraft with optimal paths. Gaming/Simulation: Creating realistic physics in digital environments. Conclusion The experiment successfully validated the theoretical model of projectile motion. By starting with Newton\u2019s Second Law and deriving the range formula, we were able to predict and confirm that: The range depends on both launch speed and angle. The maximum range occurs at 45\u00b0 . There is a symmetry in projectile behavior around this angle. The strong alignment between theory and results reinforces the practical value of mathematical modeling in physics.","title":"\ud83d\udccc Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem%201/#investigating-the-range-as-a-function-of-the-angle-of-projection","text":"","title":"\ud83d\udccc Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem%201/#problem-statement","text":"The goal of this experiment is to analyze the relationship between the launch angle ( \\(\\theta\\) ) and the horizontal range ( \\(R\\) ) of a projectile.

This type of pendulum is called a forced damped pendulum . You will learn: What the motion looks like, How to describe it with a mathematical equation, What happens when we change different parameters (like friction or the push), And how to simulate it using Python. \ud83d\udcda What Is a Forced Damped Pendulum? A normal pendulum swings back and forth because of gravity. But if you: Add friction (like air resistance), And push it periodically (like tapping it every second), ...then its motion becomes more interesting \u2014 and sometimes unpredictable. This system is called a forced damped pendulum . To study it, we use a mathematical equation. The equation describes how the pendulum moves over time. \ud83e\uddee The Equation of Motion The movement of the pendulum is described using this differential equation: \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + b\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\frac{g}{L}\\sin(\\theta) = A\\cos(\\omega t \\] Let\u2019s break it down: \\( \\theta \\) (theta) is the angle of the pendulum from the vertical (in radians). \\( \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} \\) is the acceleration (how fast the angle changes). \\( \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} \\) is the angular velocity (how fast it\u2019s swinging). \\( b \\) is the damping coefficient \u2013 it controls how strong the friction is. \\( g \\) is the gravitational acceleration (about 9.81 m/s\u00b2 on Earth). \\( L \\) is the length of the pendulum . \\( A \\) is the amplitude of the external force \u2013 how hard we are pushing it. \\( \\omega \\) (omega) is the frequency of the force \u2013 how often we push it. \\( \\cos(\\omega t) \\) is the periodic push (a cosine wave). \ud83e\udde0 Why Is This System Interesting? This system behaves in many different ways , depending on the values of the parameters. Some key behaviors: If friction is strong, the pendulum slows down and stops. If you push it at the right frequency, it can swing higher and higher \u2014 this is called resonance . If the force is strong and damping is low, the motion can become chaotic \u2014 completely unpredictable and never repeating. This is why scientists love this system: it\u2019s simple to define, but the motion can become incredibly complex. \ud83e\uddea Simplifying the Equation When the angle is very small , we can use this approximation: \\[ \\sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta \\] This turns the equation into a simpler, linear one: \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + b\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\frac{g}{L}\\theta = A\\cos(\\omega t) \\] This version is easier to solve and helps us understand basic behaviors like resonance and damping. \ud83d\udcbb Simulating the Pendulum with Python We can use a simple Python script to simulate how the pendulum moves.
