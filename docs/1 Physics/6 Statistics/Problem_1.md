# Exploring the Central Limit Theorem through simulations

## Motivation 

The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a cornerstone of probability and statistics, stating that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the populationâ€™s original distribution. Simulations provide an intuitive and hands-on way to observe this phenomenon in action.
