# ðŸ“ŒOrbital Period and Orbital Radius

## Motivation

The relationship between the square of the orbital period and the cube of the orbital radius, known as Kepler's Third Law, is a cornerstone of celestial mechanics. This simple yet profound relationship allows for the determination of planetary motions and has implications for understanding gravitational interactions on both local and cosmic scales. By analyzing this relationship, one can connect fundamental principles of gravity with real-world phenomena such as satellite orbits and planetary systems.


## Theoretical Foundation

To derive the relationship between the orbital period $T$ and the orbital radius $r$, we start by analyzing the forces acting on a satellite or planet moving in a circular orbit.

### Gravitational Force

According to Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation:

$$F = \frac{GMm}{r^2}$$

For circular motion, this must equal the centripetal force:

$$F = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$

Setting the two expressions equal:

$$\frac{GMm}{r^2} = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$

Cancel $m$ and solve for $v^2$:

$$v^2 = \frac{GM}{r}$$

### Orbital Period

The orbital period is given by:

$$T = \frac{2\pi r}{v} \Rightarrow T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 r^2}{v^2}$$

Substitute $v^2$:

$$T^2 = \frac{4\\pi^2 r^2}{\frac{GM}{r}} = \frac{4\pi^2 r^3}{GM}$$

This is the mathematical expression of Kepler's Third Law:

$$T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{GM}r^3$$

## Keplerâ€™s Third Law for Circular Orbits

Keplerâ€™s Third Law states that the square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. In the special case of circular orbits, the semi-major axis becomes the **radius** of the orbit. The law can then be written mathematically as:

$$T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{GM}r^3$$

### What does this mean?

This formula connects the time it takes for an object (like a planet or satellite) to complete one full orbit ($T$), with how far it is from the body itâ€™s orbiting ($r$).

- $T$ is the orbital period (in seconds)
- $r$ is the orbital radius (in meters)
- $G$ is the gravitational constant ($6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \mathrm{m^3/kg \cdot s^2}$)
- $M$ is the mass of the central body (like the Sun or Earth)

### Why does it work?

An object in orbit is constantly falling toward the massive body (like Earth or the Sun), but also moving forward. The gravitational force provides the **centripetal force** needed to keep it moving in a circle.

By equating these forces and solving for the orbital period, we derive Kepler's Third Law. Itâ€™s not just an observational rule â€” it comes directly from Newtonâ€™s laws of motion and gravity.

### Why is it important?

This law allows scientists to:

- Calculate how long it takes for something to orbit (if they know the distance)
- Estimate how far an object is (if they know its orbital period)
- Determine the mass of stars or planets by observing their satellites

### Does it always apply?

This exact formula applies **only for circular orbits**. For elliptical orbits, the law still holds, but $r$ must be replaced by the **semi-major axis $a$** of the ellipse.

$$T^2 \propto a^3$$

So while this is a simplified version, it gives an extremely accurate model for most planetary and satellite motion.

## Implications in Astronomy

Kepler's Third Law has profound applications in astronomy and astrophysics. It enables scientists to:

- Determine the mass of celestial bodies such as stars and planets
- Calculate orbital distances from observed periods
- Compare orbital dynamics across different planetary systems

The formula

$$T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{GM}r^3$$

allows astronomers to compute the mass $M$ of a central body if $T$ and $r$ are known.

## Real-World Examples

We verify the relationship by computing $\frac{T^2}{r^3}$ for real bodies.

### Moon orbiting Earth

- $r = 3.84 \times 10^8$ m
- $T = 2.36 \times 10^6$ s

$$\frac{T^2}{r^3} = \frac{(2.36 \times 10^6)^2}{(3.84 \times 10^8)^3} \approx 1.01 \times 10^{-13}$$

---

### Earth orbiting the Sun

- $r = 1.496 \times 10^{11}$ m
- $T = 3.156 \times 10^7$ s

$$\frac{T^2}{r^3} = \frac{(3.156 \times 10^7)^2}{(1.496 \times 10^{11})^3} \approx 1.00 \times 10^{-13}$$

---



The near-equality of $\frac{T^2}{r^3}$ confirms Kepler's Third Law in real data.


### Visualizing Keplerâ€™s Third Law â€“ $T^2$ vs $r^3$

To experimentally verify Keplerâ€™s Third Law, we plotted the square of the orbital period ($T^2$) against the cube of the orbital radius ($r^3$) for selected planets in our Solar System.

The graph shows a clear linear relationship between $T^2$ and $r^3$, supporting the lawâ€™s mathematical prediction that $T^2 \propto r^3$.

This relationship is essential in understanding how orbital mechanics scale with distance and is consistent with Newtonâ€™s formulation of gravitation.

## Estimating Mass of the Sun and Earth Using Keplerâ€™s Law

Keplerâ€™s Third Law can be rearranged into a form that allows us to estimate the mass of the central body in a two-body system:

$$
M = \frac{4\pi^2 r^3}{G T^2}
$$

#### Estimating the Mass of the Sun (from Earthâ€™s orbit)

We use Earth's orbit around the Sun:

- Orbital radius:  
  ($ r = 1.496 \times 10^{11} \ \text{m} $)
- Orbital period:  
  ($ T = 365.25 \times 24 \times 3600 \ \text{s} = 3.15576 \times 10^7 \ \text{s} $)
- Gravitational constant:  
  ($ G = 6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \ \mathrm{m^3/kg/s^2} $)

Plugging into the formula:

$$[
M = \frac{4\pi^2 (1.496 \times 10^{11})^3}{6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \cdot (3.15576 \times 10^7)^2}
\approx 1.989 \times 10^{30} \ \text{kg}
]$$

This value matches the accepted mass of the Sun.

#### Estimating the Mass of the Earth (from Moonâ€™s orbit)

We now use the Moonâ€™s orbit around the Earth:

- Orbital radius:  
  ($ r = 3.84 \times 10^8 \ \text{m} $)
- Orbital period:  
  ($ T = 27.3 \times 24 \times 3600 \ \text{s} = 2.36 \times 10^6 \ \text{s} $)

Using the same formula:

$$[
M = \frac{4\pi^2 (3.84 \times 10^8)^3}{6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \cdot (2.36 \times 10^6)^2}
\approx 5.97 \times 10^{24} \ \text{kg}
]$$

This aligns with the accepted mass of the Earth.

These examples show how Keplerâ€™s Third Law can be used not only to understand orbital dynamics but also to extract fundamental physical quantities such as mass from observable orbital data.





## Simulated Circular Orbits of Planets

This visualization shows simulated circular orbits of the eight major planets in the Solar System around the Sun. Each orbit is drawn to scale based on its average orbital radius in astronomical units (AU).

This figure serves as a **conceptual demonstration** of Keplerâ€™s laws in action, illustrating how:

- Each planet moves in a wider orbit as its distance from the Sun increases
- The time it takes to complete one revolution also increases (per Kepler's Third Law)

### Key Observations:

- **Mercury and Venus** are tightly packed near the Sun, indicating shorter orbital periods
- **Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune** span large distances, reflecting their long orbital times
- **All orbits are modeled as circular**, which simplifies the visualization while retaining the radial scaling

This graphical representation reinforces the idea that the orbital radius directly influences the dynamics of planetary motion.

## Conclusion

In this project, we investigated the fundamental principles of orbital mechanics through the lens of Keplerâ€™s Third Law. Beginning with a theoretical derivation using Newton's laws of motion and gravitation, we established the relationship between orbital period and radius:

$$[
T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{GM} r^3
]$$

This expression was then tested using real planetary data from the Solar System. Our $T^2$ vs $r^3$ plot demonstrated a strong linear correlation, empirically verifying Keplerâ€™s prediction.

Beyond verification, we extended the application of this law by:

- Estimating the mass of the Sun using Earthâ€™s orbital parameters
- Calculating the Earthâ€™s mass using the Moonâ€™s orbit
- Simulating planetary orbits and visualizing their scale and dynamics
- Discussing the broader implications of Keplerâ€™s Law in astronomy and space exploration

Through both theoretical and computational methods, the project not only confirmed Keplerâ€™s Law but also highlighted how classical mechanics enables us to infer properties of celestial bodies from observational data.

This work provides a robust foundation for understanding orbital dynamics and supports the development of more advanced astrophysical models and mission planning in space science.
