# ** ðŸ“ŒOrbital Period and Orbital Radius**

## Motivation

The relationship between the square of the orbital period and the cube of the orbital radius, known as Kepler's Third Law, is a cornerstone of celestial mechanics. This simple yet profound relationship allows for the determination of planetary motions and has implications for understanding gravitational interactions on both local and cosmic scales. By analyzing this relationship, one can connect fundamental principles of gravity with real-world phenomena such as satellite orbits and planetary systems.
